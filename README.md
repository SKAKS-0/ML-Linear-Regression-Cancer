# ML-Linear-Regression-Cancer
Python ML code using linear regression algorithm to predict if tumor is cancerous.

The code does the following:
 1. Reads CSV file
 2. Divides dataset into training and testing sets
 3. Creates a model
 4. Trains the model
 5. Tests the model and prints accuracy
 6. (loop) the loop creates 30 models and picks the most accurate (you can skip this part or change number of iterations)
 7. Saves model into a file 
 8. Uses model for prediction
